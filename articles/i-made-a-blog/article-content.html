    <h3>I made it from scratch.</h3>
  </header>

  <h4>Why</h4>

  <p>I spend much of my alone-time doing creative things, but I don't have a good outlet for the things I create.</p>

  <p>This has an effect on my motivation to finish side-projects. My hope is that this page will give my projects a destination, and lead me to complete more of them.</p>

  <p>This post is about my first such project: this blog, and the tiny platform it runs on. I have taken on more invigorating projects, but few so pleasingly minimal.</p>

  <h4>How</h4>

  <p>This blog is a static site.</p>

  <p>There is no server-side rendering. There is no content management system. The only things that runs on the server are the operating system and the webserver.</p>

  <p>There is no client-side behaviour. No javascript<sup>1</sup>.</p>

  <p>Articles are written in raw HTML. All article styling is done without classes, which makes writing raw HTML quite smooth. Content from articles is compiled into the multi-article pages and permalink pages that make up the site.</p>

  <h4>Permalinks and Multi-Article Pages</h4>

  <p>The page you're on right now is what I'll call a permalink page. It contains a single article and has a nice URL. URLs are made nice thanks to the way standard webservers handle index.html by default.</p>

  <figure>
    <img src="/articles/i-made-a-blog/folder-structure.png" alt="Article folder structure" />
    <figcaption>Permalink!</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><a href="/">The homepage</a> is a multi-article page. At the time of writing there is only one article, but articles will eventually be grouped in threes or fours on these pages when there are more of them.</p>

  <h4>Compilation</h4>

  <p>There is a compile/render step, but it doesn't happen on the server - it happens on my development machine.</p>

  <p>The content of this article, for example, sits in <strong>/articles/i-made-a-blog/article-content.html</strong>. A bash script concatenates it into the site template, and saves the resulting index.html into the output permalink folder.</p>

  <p>A short copy of this article sits in <strong>/articles/i-made-a-blog/article-preview.html</strong>. The same script concatenates that preview and neighbouring article previews into multi-article pages, like the homepage.</p>

  <p>Here's the meat of the script. I've skipped the preamble and cleanup.</p>

  <figure>
    <figcaption><strong>render.sh</strong> (Bash)</figcaption>
    <pre><code class="language-bash">buildCurrentPermalinkDocument(){
  file=$currentDir/article-content.html
  `cat $pageStart $file $pageEnd > $currentDir/index.html`
}

buildCurrentMultiArticleDocument(){
  let "pagenum += 1"
  `mkdir page/$pagenum`
  `cat $pageStart $currentArticles $pageEnd > page/$pagenum/index.html`
}

render(){
  # $database is a text file which lists article dirs
  for articleDir in $database; do
    currentDir=$articleDir;
    currentArticles="$currentArticles $currentDir/article-preview.html"
  
    let "articleIndex += 1"
    if [ `expr $articleIndex % $articlesPerPage` -eq 0 ]; then
      buildCurrentMultiArticleDocument
      currentArticles=""
    fi

    buildCurrentPermalinkDocument
  done

  # build a multi-article page from the remainder articles
  if [ currentArticles != "" ]; then
    buildCurrentMultiArticleDocument
    currentArticles=""
  fi
}</code></pre>
  </figure>

  <p>This spits out the complete state of my blog! Then rsync moves it to the server. Done.</p>

  <h4>Independent</h4>

  <p>I'm tempted to do the rendering in something a little more fresh, like Python. However, right now the only development dependencies I have are a text editor and unix.</p>

  <p>This means if I lose this laptop in a fire, I can borrow nearly any non-windows computer, download a zip from GitHub, and write a new blog post without having to install anything. Another benefit is the low risk of my tools becoming obsolete.</p>

  <h4>Clientside, Serverside, Developerside</h4>

  <p>Things are even better when we're talking about the server dependencies. Since all of the rendering happens on my development machine, the server only needs to be able to serve documents. In a race between installing Wordpress and installing this blog, this blog wins before anyone reaches for the starting gun.</p>

  <p>Of course this wouldn't scale to anything one might call an &ldquo;app,&rdquo; but I'm not making an app! I'm making a slowly growing static site, and this method ought to handle that just fine.</p>

    <p><sup>1</sup> &ldquo;There is no client-side behaviour. No javascript.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>At the time of writing, this was true. I have since added syntax highlighting with <a href="http://prismjs.com/">prism.js</a>. I plan to eventually move syntax highlighting to the dev machine compilation.</p>
