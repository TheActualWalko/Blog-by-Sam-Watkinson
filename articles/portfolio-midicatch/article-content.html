  <h4>Primer: What's MIDI?</h4>
  <p>MIDI, which stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface, is a protocol for communication between digital instruments and things that make sounds.</p>
  <p>You can think of it as a way for your digital piano to talk to your computer: when you play a note on your piano keyboard, your computer is told which note was played, and how hard it was pressed. Your computer can then use this information to make a noise. Perhaps a piano noise, but perhaps a guitar, a drum, a synthesizer, or anything else your music-making computer might have installed.</p>

  <h4>How people use MIDI</h4>
  <p>One of the nice things about MIDI is that it's a very space-efficient way of communicating complex musical ideas.</p>
  <p>For example, a sixty-second audio recording of a piano will occupy a little under 2.5 megabytes of space. Meanwhile, the complete MIDI representation of Carly Rae Jepsen's "Call Me Maybe" occupies a miniscule 53 kilobytes.</p>
  <p>Another great benefit of working with MIDI is editing flexibility. After recording a MIDI part, a musician can go back and move notes around, correct timing issues, and adjust the amplitude of particular notes until the result is perfect.</p>
  <p>Because of these advantages, it's common for electronic musicians to entirely avoid using recorded audio in their work, instead recording MIDI from a variety of hardware devices (like MIDI drum pads and MIDI keyboards) and generating sounds in their computers instead.</p>

  <h4>MIDICatch</h4>
  <p>I made <a href="http://midicatch.com">MIDICatch</a> to act as a live backup tool for MIDI-centric music makers.</p>
  <p>Because I often experiment with melodies and beats on my MIDI controller before I start recording with my music-making software, I can save only those musical ideas that I'm able to play twice. The problem is that I can't always do this - often, a good idea will come and go before I can play it again. Unless I happen to be recording when inspiration visits, the idea is lost forever.</p>
  <p>That's why MIDICatch has become incredibly useful to me. Even if the software I use to record MIDI isn't running, MIDICatch faithfully sits in the background, capturing every MIDI note that comes into my computer. If I find myself playing something cool that doesn't get recorded in the normal way, I can just pop open the MIDICatch dropdown in my menu bar and grab the latest recording. It's a truly indispensable tool.</p>
