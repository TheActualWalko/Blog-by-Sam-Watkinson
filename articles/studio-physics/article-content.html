    <h3>Bite-sized audio recording physics</h3>
  </header>


  <h4>Inspiration</h4>

  <p>The process described by this post hit me like a sack of tuning forks one morning while setting up to record <a href="http://www.pgfreepress.com/music-for-earth-day/">Piano Music for Earth Hour</a>.</p>

  <p>To the learned or experienced sound recordist, producer, "audio guy", this is old news. To me - only recently having committed myself to truly understanding audio technology - it represented a sudden coming-together of new knowledge, a phase alignment so well-synchronized it may have made an audible click.</p>


  <h4>The Piano</h4>

  <p>A hammer strikes a piano string. Set into motion by the strike, the piano string bends infinitesimally in one direction. Eventually the tension becomes too much, and the bending slows to a stop and begins in the opposite direction. Each string of middle A will return to its maximum bend in this direction four hundred and forty times per second.</p>


  <h4>The Air</h4>

  <p>Right around the string, the air is in chaos, moving out of the way of the flailing wire, then rushing in to fill the void left by the wire's furious movement. There is order though, as the fluid dynamics of this system settle into a rhythm with the same fundamental tone as our piano string - 440Hz.</p>

  <p>As the string wobbles to and fro, shaking off the energy imparted to it by the striking of the hammer, the air some inches away begins to take notice, settling into the same 440Hz oscillation. Air pushes away, air pulls back. Air pushes away, air pulls back.</p>


  <h4>The Mic</h4>

  <p>Three or four feet from the piano, our microphone awaits the direct signal it was brought here to capture. Fluttering minutely in response to tiny random vibrations - noise - started by distant air conditioning units, the wind outside, an audio engineer in the room recoiling as he experiences a sudden cosmic moment of technical comprehension, the energy and resounding purity of the piano note's effect on the air is an exciting change of pace for the microphone's diaphragm. </p>

  <p>The diaphragm is a thin surface that exists to move as the air moves. The movement of a wave through air is communicated almost exactly to the diaphragm. The diaphragm follows the air, which follows the piano string. Now two solid objects in this room have caught the 440Hz bug.</p>


  <p>Behind the diaphragm, a simple system of magnets and electromagnetic wire are taking care of our first major transduction: the coercion of our signal from acoustic to electric. Air to charge.</p>


  <h4>The Cable</h4>

  <p>The diaphragm has a coil behind it that encircles an electromagnet. As the diaphragm moves, so moves the coil, imparting a tiny difference in charge across the magnet. Leads on either end of the magnet respond to this change by becoming charged negatively, then positively as the diaphragm gains speed in the other direction.</p>

  <p>At the rear of the microphone we find one end of the cable; an extension of the microphone circuit that will carry this fluctuating charge to the next piece of the puzzle.</p>


  <h4>The Analog-to-Digital Converter</h4>

  <p>At the other end of the cable we find the ADC. After scaling up the magnitude of these tiny oscillations in charge, a network of resistors and comparators capture the current degree of charge as a discrete value. They capture this digital value 44,100 times per second.</p>


  <h4>The Computer</h4>

  <p>What happens next is safely put in a black box labeled "here be dragons." Our fluctuating energies and physical oscillations have become raw math. Calculation upon calculation transform, reduce, modulate, amplify, invert, confound, resolve, perfect our signal - derived from reality but now in an entirely virtual form.</p>


  <h4>The Return</h4>

  <p>Later the process will be reversed; a symmetrical system will convert the ones and zeroes of our digital signal back into a smooth oscillation of electric charge, which in turn will magnetize a coil behind a much larger diaphragm, which will now take the role of exciting the air around it, so that it may propagate to the last great transducer - the ear.</p>
