Comparison to programming
"Sometimes to find the best way forward, we programmers have to let go of the framework we've built up to understand a problem."

Clinton supporters and Trump supporters have both been presented a very grim perspective of their opponent. It's reasonable to excuse crude comments in the face of massive, ruthless, illegal activity.

The bigotry of Trump supporters probably sits on a very broad spectrum.

I assume some of us have a perspective of Trump supporters as hopelessly blind, brainwashed, and heartless, because i have to fight off this feeling myself. But it needs to be fought off because it just isn't true.

Acknowledge powerful arguments like "what do i tell my kids after years of saying "bigotry and intolerance will get you nowhere"

    <h3>A programmer's approach to understanding the election.</h3>
  </header>

  <h4>Frameworks</h4>

  <p>Often, in order to find the best way forward, we programmers have to let go of whatever mental framework we've built up in an attempt to better understand a problem.</p>
  
  <p>In order to understand this election, I've had to cast off my own mental framework for politics in the US. And I think I'm better for it. I want to share that with you, because I do believe some good will come of this result.</p>

  <p>Before I continue, I want to acknowledge and point out some things.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>I am a heterosexual, cis, white, upper-middle-class male.</li>
    <li>I am Canadian and know less than five rural Americans.</li>
    <li>I am moving to New York City in three days.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>What I'm saying is I don't know what I'm talking about. I have not felt the pain of having my entire race or gender insulted by a president-elect. I hardly know anything about US culture. The degree to which this election affects me is probably very small.</p>

  <p>But I'm a programmer, and that means I take a very measured approach to learning and setting myself up for new information. Here's how I'm setting myself up to understand this.</p>

  <h4>Opposition</h4>

  <p>No matter who you support, this is what you've been told.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The other candidate is the second coming of Hitler</li>
    <li>The other candidate's party has been in power during all of America's worst moments</li>
    <li>The other candidate has openly and proudly insulted millions of Americans</li>
    <li>There's something about the other candidate's mind that makes him or her categorically unfit for the presidency</li>
    <li>It is okay to absolutely detest the other candidate</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The list continues. Think about the opposition - how many of those points do you actually believe? In my case, all of them. Deep down, reading those things and thinking about Trump fills me with a deep, resounding agreement. Of COURSE those things are true. It's so obvious! Trumps supporters must be blind, or brainwashed, or both, if they can't see it!</p>

  <p>But those are my emotions talking. As a programmer, I've got some practice putting those aside and taking a more pragmatic view of things.</p>

  <h4>Spectrum</h4>

  <p>My framework of the election used to look something like this:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Trump supporters must be absolute bigots because they don't care that he expresses bigotry</li>
    <li>Trump supporters must be foolish because Trump will clearly put the country in jeopardy as president</li>
    <li>Trump supporters must be heartless because the don't care about his insults to the rest of the country</li>
  </ul>

  <p>There are issues here. All of these points are very absolute, and have me imagining Trump's supporters as a single, very unpleasant human being, multiplied by 59,588,434. Sometimes the framework has to be adjusted to allow some flexibility.</p>
